Oh, hush, my dear, it's been a difficult year
And terrors don’t prey on innocent victims
Trust me, darlin', trust me darlin'
It’s been a loveless year
I'm a man of three fears:
Integrity, faith, and crocodile tears
Trust me, darlin', trust me, darlin'

[Pre-Chorus]
So look me in the eyes (Eyes), tell me what you see (You see)
Perfect paradise (—Dise), tearin' at the seams (Seams)
I wish I could escape it (Escape), I don't wanna fake it
Wish I could erase it (Erase), make your heart believe
